			<p class="faq_intro pgintro  regular_f">Here are some of our most frequently asked questions. If you don’t find the answer you’re looking for here then <a href="http://matakata.com.au/matakata/contact/">get in touch</a>, we love a chat!</p>
			<div class="question_cont">
				<p class="question">What areas do you cover and is there a delivery charge?</p>
				<p class="answer">We are based in the Sydney and cover all surrounding areas including the Kangaroo and Hunter Valleys. For events a little further away, we may have to charge for delivery however get in touch and we’ll see what we can do!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question_cont">
				<p class="question">Are the Tipis ok in all types of weather?</p>
				<p class="answer">Our Tipis are pretty tough cookies! Initially designed to withstand the harsh weather conditions of the Arctic Circle, they can handle anything Australia decides to throw at them! The only time we would review the safety of your event is during seriously high winds – for that reason, it is best to choose a well-sheltered site.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question_cont">
				<p class="question">What do i need to consider when choosing a site for the Tipi?</p>
				<p class="answer">The main things to consider when choosing a Tipi site are:<br /><br />
				– Does the site have 4WD access? (for easy delivery of the Tipi)
				<br />
				– Is the site large enough? (check out our Tipi Layouts(hyperlink) for sizes)
				<br />
				– Is the site level?
				<br />
				– Is the site liable to flooding?
				<br />
				– Is there an electricity supply? (we can provide a generator if not)
				<br /><br />
				If in doubt, speak to us, we’ll advise as best we can!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question_cont">
				<p class="question">What is the procedure for booking a Tipi?</p>
				<p class="answer">Firstly, Contact Us to check availability and discuss the requirements for your event. Once we have confirmed we can help, we will send you a booking form to complete. We’ll require a 25% deposit to lock-in your event and then the balance three weeks before the big day.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question_cont">
				<p class="question">Can I style my own Tipi or customise one of your pre-styled Tipi packages?</p>
				<p class="answer">Of course! Feel free to style the Tipi anyway you want, the options are endless! The packages are there to provide inspiration – talk to us about customising those packages in any way.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question_cont">
				<p class="question">What is the hire period for a Tipi?</p>
				<p class="answer">All prices quoted are for a full days hire however we typically setup the tipi the day before and remove the tipi the day after your event. If you need the tipi for longer, just ask and we can provide a quote that will cover your entire event.</p>
